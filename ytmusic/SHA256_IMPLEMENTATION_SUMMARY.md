# SHA-256 Hash-Based Track IDs Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Hash Generation Function
- **Function**: `generate_track_id(title, artist)`
- **Algorithm**: SHA-256 with string normalization
- **Output**: 64-character hexadecimal hash

### 2. String Normalization
The normalization process ensures consistent IDs:
- Converts to lowercase
- Removes special characters (keeping only word characters and spaces)
- Normalizes whitespace (removes extra spaces)
- Trims leading/trailing spaces

### 3. Key Benefits

#### Deterministic IDs
- Same track (title + artist) always generates the same ID
- No need for UUID generation
- Predictable and consistent

#### Automatic Deduplication
- Prevents duplicate tracks in database
- Hash collision detection (track already exists)
- Efficient direct lookups instead of table scans

#### Performance Improvements
- **Before**: Table scan to find existing tracks
- **After**: Direct key lookup using generated ID
- Significantly faster database operations

### 4. Updated Functions

#### `create_new_track(youtube_data)`
- Generates hash-based ID from title and artist
- Checks if track already exists before creating
- Returns existing ID if track already exists

#### `check_track_exists(title, artist)`
- Generates expected track ID
- Performs direct DynamoDB lookup (not scan)
- Much more efficient than previous implementation

#### `lambda_handler(event, context)`
- Uses hash-based approach for track management
- Better error handling and logging
- Returns stored track ID in response

### 5. Example Hash Generation

```
"Bohemian Rhapsody" by "Queen" -> b7f0c85a52c9338579274464931ab2c8a4e666c5d4a8e60357da8ad62161cd44
"bohemian rhapsody" by "queen" -> b7f0c85a52c9338579274464931ab2c8a4e666c5d4a8e60357da8ad62161cd44  # Same ID
"Let It Be" by "The Beatles" -> cc348a905aecd385e5c86c1d15110be36cbb253ea76cfaece1d36483ee663ab0
```

### 6. Collision Resistance
- SHA-256 provides excellent collision resistance
- Extremely unlikely to have two different tracks with same ID
- If collision occurs (virtually impossible), existing track is returned

### 7. Database Efficiency
- **Primary Key**: Direct lookup by hash ID
- **No Scanning**: Eliminates expensive table scans
- **Consistency**: Same track always has same ID across different Lambda invocations

### 8. Testing
- Comprehensive test suite in `test_hash_generation.py`
- Validates normalization works correctly
- Confirms consistent ID generation

## Usage Examples

### Creating New Track
```python
# Generate ID for track
track_id = generate_track_id("Bohemian Rhapsody", "Queen")
# track_id = "b7f0c85a52c9338579274464931ab2c8a4e666c5d4a8e60357da8ad62161cd44"

# Check if exists (O(1) lookup)
existing = check_track_exists("Bohemian Rhapsody", "Queen")

# Create if doesn't exist
if not existing:
    new_track_id = create_new_track(youtube_data)
```

### Lambda Event
```json
{
    "title": "Bohemian Rhapsody",
    "author": "Queen"
}
```

### Response
```json
{
    "statusCode": 200,
    "body": {
        "title": "Bohemian Rhapsody",
        "artist": "Queen",
        "videoId": "fJ9rUzIMcZQ",
        "url": "https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ9rUzIMcZQ",
        "stored_track_id": "b7f0c85a52c9338579274464931ab2c8a4e666c5d4a8e60357da8ad62161cd44"
    }
}
```

## Migration Considerations
- Existing UUID-based tracks remain unchanged
- New tracks use hash-based IDs
- System supports both ID formats
- Gradual migration possible
